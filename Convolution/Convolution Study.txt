So what is convolution ?

Mathematically : g(x,y) = s(-a,a)Σ t(-b,b)Σ w(s,t) f(x-s, y-t)
while 
(x,y) = pixel
f = input image
w = kernel
g = output image
a,b = apperture radius 

It is a mathematical function which can be used to modify a input image.
A small group pixels are processed at a single time (kernel) then this is made sure to cover the entire pixels of image.

Major Applications of Convolutions :
# Feature Extraction.
# Image filters.
